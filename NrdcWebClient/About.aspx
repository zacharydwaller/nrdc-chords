                The Nevada Research Data Center serves in a critical role of science cyberinfrastructure
                for sensor-based research data management. We facilitate the acquisition, transport,
                storage, query, and dissemination of observational data created by automated digital sensor
                systems. The NRDC participates in cutting-edge software and systems development to enhance
                next-generation science that leverages the Internet of Things (IoT). Our goal is to transform
                the scale, quality, impact, and bottom-line cost of research projects in Nevada that seek to
                deploy automated sensor systems as part of their scientific workflow.
